2. disable exit(exit+finish)(can be combined with key control)  
3. Disable popup box by keyword (hover window + dialog box) (can be combined with key control)  
4. Version customization (version number + version name)  
5. Disguise the system time (system time + GPS time + local access to the server time)  
6. Anti-detection of this module, Xposed, Root  
7. Disable network at startup (can set the disable time)  
8. Force to end the current activity (Activity) (control by key combination)

## Cautions
1. This module does not support the latest dialogs and game dialogs! (Some latest dialogs are very similar to normal dialogs, please pay attention to distinguish them!)  # Frida inject
